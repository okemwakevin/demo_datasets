1,"New taxes push cars beyond the reach of more Kenyans    TUESDAY AUGUST 15 2023    graphic    GRAPHIC | GENNEVIEVE AWINO | NMG            Imported car dealers have increased prices by up to Sh330,000 for some units as they pass on new taxes and currency depreciation costs to consumers in what has pushed the popular models beyond the reach of more Kenyans.    A comprehensive analysis of the impact of the new taxes on prices has revealed that the actual taxes on imported second-hand cars have jumped by an average of 14.69 percent, outpacing the 10 percent import duty increment imposed by the William Ruto administration.    Read: Used car prices rally on shortage, dollar strength    The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) increased duty on imported cars to 35 percent from the previous 25 percent, setting the stage for the latest wave of price increments amid the weakening of the shilling.    The 10-percentage point rise on import taxes has also ended up increasing the other taxes on cars such as the excise duty and value added tax (VAT) as these taxes are loaded and paid cumulatively in that order.    The Kenya Auto Bazaar Association, which represents second-hand car dealers, said its members were bracing for further slowdown in sales due to higher prices.    RELATED STORIES    DNHCVLaunch0303d    New vehicle dealers sales drop 14pc on prices surge    cars    Vehicle demand declines 17pc as prices jump    The full impact on demand, the lobby’s secretary general Charles Munyori said, will likely be felt from September when most of the orders under the new taxation regime dock at the Port of Mombasa.    “What we see happening is that people are going to change their preferences because of higher prices. Some people who would have preferred to buy a Prado, for example, may decide to import a Nissan X-Trail,” Mr Munyori said.    “For importers, if you are bringing in 10 [Toyota] Harriers, you may cut it to seven because of the high costs.”    The shilling, which has lost more than 20 percent of its value in this year, and the increase in interest rates are making the cars even more costlier. Importing a V8 car, for example, costs around $70,000.    Bringing this luxury car at an exchange rate of Sh147 today would see a dealer cough up to Sh10.29 million. A year ago, at an exchange rate of Sh105, a dealer paid Sh7.35 million.    This means if you used to import 10 V8 cars, you now pay an extra Sh29.4 million.    The increased duty is part of the Ruto administration’s plan to raise Sh211 billion in additional revenue this financial year ending June 2024.    Calculations by second-hand car dealers suggest the total taxes on the cheapest units assembled in 2016 – the shipment they are largely bringing in currently based on the eight-year age limit – have risen by more than Sh330,000 for luxurious cars.    Importation of vehicles attracts excise duty ranging from 25 percent to 35 percent depending on the size of the engine, while the standard 16 VAT also applies.    Excise tax is charged on sum of landed cost of the car and import duty, with VAT applied on the resultant value.    The estimates show total taxes on low-priced Toyota Vitz manufactured in 2016 have gone up by Sh32,070 or 14.94 percent on the impact of increased duty to Sh246,709 per unit, excluding storage charges and registration fees.    This has pushed up the cost of an imported second-hand Vitz to more than Sh1.3 million.    The cost of a Mazda Demio, popularly with digital taxi operators, is also hovering around Sh1.3 million after taxes increased about Sh28,619, while the price of a Nissan Note has crossed Sh1.2 million after taxes went up Sh32,549.    The retail prices have factored in other costs such as foreign exchange rates and dealer’s margin, which is usually about 10 percent.    A newly imported Toyota VX model (4600cc engine capacity) manufactured in 2016, popular with lawmakers and corporate chiefs, is retailing at more than Sh14 million after taxes increased by Sh259,612 to stand at about Sh2.14 million.    The prices of Toyota Harrier (2000cc) and Nissan X-Trail (2500cc), which are popular with the middle class, have increased by Sh107,059 and Sh116,901, respectively.    Besides taxes, fully assembled vehicles shipped in from abroad are also charged import declaration fee and railway development levy at the rates of 2.5 percent and 1.5 percent of the customs value, respectively.    Motor vehicle dealers and assemblers had earlier raised car prices citing depreciation of the shilling, reduced imports of used units and rising borrowing costs.    Production of cars slowed down globally in the wake of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic besides shortages of semiconductors, which are a critical component in modern vehicles.    The shilling, on the other hand, has been weakening against the US dollar, losing about 16.4 percent of value since the beginning of the year.    The increased cost of operation had prompted the dealers and assemblers of new vehicles to adjust prices upwards to recoup the expenses and protect margins even before the duty on finished units was enforced.    New vehicles dealers, for example, posted a 12.5 percent drop in sales in the half year through June to 5,679 units, according to data from Kenya Motor Industry Association (KMIA).    Read: Used car prices jump up to 30pc in three months    Most of the dealers, including Isuzu East Africa and Simba Corp, registered lower sales year-on-year, while CFAO Motors Kenya, newly merged from the former Toyota Kenya and DT Dobie, bucked the trend to post higher sales.    ? cmunda@ke.nationmedia.com",Economy
2,"How borrowers can survive higher interest rate cycles   FRIDAY AUGUST 11 2023   shutterstock_2025042668   Interest rate futures can be used to hedge against the risk associated with changes in interest rates. PHOTO | SHUTTERSTOCK          The ever-changing interest rates slapped on credit by banks due to changes in the central bank reference rate set by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), continue to worry many Kenyans.   The committee reviews the Central Bank Rate (CBR), which informs how banks price their loans or mortgages from time to time.   Interest rates change over time primarily due to adjustments made by the CBK to CBR also known as the discount, benchmark, or key interest rate.   This is the interest at, which local commercial banks can borrow from the CBK, which impacts what they charge their customers. In addition, the regulator can adjust the base rate to manage economic growth and inflation.   When an economy is overheating, with rising inflation, the CBK might increase the base rate to cool down spending and borrowing leading to higher interest rates for loans and mortgages.   Conversely, in periods of economic downturn or recession, it may lower the base rate to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, which translates into lower interest rates.   RELATED STORIES   DNCBK2712C   Bank loan rates rise past 20pc in repricing cycle    Central Bank of Kenya    Central Bank seen raising benchmark rate to 5-year high in 2023   Therefore, the changing base rate is a crucial determinant of the fluctuation in interest rates over time.   This shift was prompted by the CBK’s decision on June 26 to increase the Central Bank Rate (CBR) from 9.5 percent to 10.5 percent translating to 100 basis points increase.   The MPC noted that persistent inflationary pressures, increased risks to the inflation outlook, heightened global risks, and potential impacts on the domestic economy necessitate tightening the monetary policy in Kenya.   This jump was primarily driven by fuel and food costs to 10.2 percent and non-food non-fuel prices.   Read: CBK reveals cheapest and most expensive Kenyan banks   When the decision was made, primarily due to the economic situation in the Kenyan market, many banks quickly reacted to this new development.   Access Bank was the first to announce a rise in loan pricing following the newly revised rates.   During the same week, Equity Bank also adjusted their new loan interest rates in response to the new CBK figure.   The way out   Financial derivatives are financial instruments whose value is got from an underlying asset or a group of assets.   These underlying entities can encompass stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indexes.   The primary use of financial derivatives is to hedge against the risk of significant interest rate fluctuations, but they can also serve speculative purposes, particularly concerning Libor rates.   Financial derivatives manifest in various forms, each having distinct characteristics and uses. Futures are a type of financial derivative.   These contracts bind the borrower or seller to dispose of an asset, whether a tangible commodity or a financial instrument. They are unique in establishing a preset date and price for this transaction.   Secondly, there are options for contracts. An options contract provides the buyer with flexibility, granting them the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a specific underlying asset.   The precise actions that will be taken hinge on the type of contract the buyer holds.   The third type is forward contracts which are non-standardised agreements drawn between two parties. Similar to futures, it stipulates the buying or selling of an asset at a predetermined future date. However, the price is agreed upon in the present.   Lastly, swaps are another form of financial derivative contracts. In a swap, two parties, namely banks, agree to exchange financial instruments.   The instruments involved in a swap can vary, including interest rates, commodities, or foreign exchange.   Remember that using these financial derivatives does carry its risks, including that the other party could default and the risk that the hedge will not perform as expected.   Therefore, those who understand these loan products and their risks should only use such strategies.   Financial derivatives can help reduce exposure to interest rate risk by allowing businesses and individuals to manage or hedge their interest rate sensitivity.   These tools can create predictability and stability in fluctuating interest rates when properly utilised.   An interest rate swap effectively manages exposure to fluctuations by permitting an entity to exchange its position.   For instance, a Kenyan bank with a floating rate loan is vulnerable to rising charges. By engaging in an interest rate swap agreement where they receive a floating and pay a fixed interest rate, the bank effectively converts its obligation to a fixed interest rate thus remaining on a firm footing.   Interest rate futures can be used to hedge against the risk associated with changes in interest rates. If a business foresees a rise in interest rates, it can engage in short-selling interest rate futures.   If the rates rise as anticipated, the value of the futures contracts will decrease, leading to a gain that can offset the increased borrowing cost.   On the other hand, if a drop in interest rates is expected, a long position in futures can be established.   Read: Banks hit big companies with higher interest rates   Options on interest rate futures allow the borrower to hedge against drastic movements in interest rates. Suppose a Kenyan holds an option to buy interest-rate futures (call option), and rates increase significantly.   In that case, the entity can exercise the option to buy the futures at a lower price than the current market rate, thereby profiting from the difference.   If interest rates do not change as expected, the holder's loss is limited to the price paid for the option (the premium).   Kenya ought to develop an infrastructure where these financial instruments can be developed to ensure that weathering financial storms are a problem of the past since financial derivatives can buffer against interest rate variability experienced today.

3,"DATA HUB   How KRA exploits clashing court rulings to hit taxpayers with backdated charges   TUESDAY AUGUST 08 2023   DNKRA2211vr   Times Tower in Nairobi, the headquarters of Kenya Revenue Authority. FILE PHOTO | DENNIS ONSONGO | NMG          The conundrum that taxpayers are grappling with after the lifting of conservatory orders suspending implementation of the Finance Act 2023 by the Court of Appeal is whether the new tax changes will apply as from July 1 when most provisions of the Act came into force or as from July 28 when the orders were lifted.   For context, it is important to provide some background. First, the Finance Act 2023 was gazetted on June 26, introducing a myriad of far-reaching tax changes to be effected on various dates, as from July 1, September 1 and the last of the changes to come into play on January 1, 2024.   Of importance, the new Pay as You Earn (PAYE) rates for individuals were to come into force on July 1. Additionally, the controversial affordable housing levy, which would apply a rate of 1.5 percent on employee gross pay with a matched contribution by employers, was to take effect on the same date.   Other tax changes coming into force on July 1 included the increase of VAT on petroleum products from eight percent to 16 percent, mandatory remittance of withholding and withholding VAT taxes within five working days among others.   In normal circumstances, employers and other businesses would have implemented the new taxes with effect from July 1.   However, shortly after the Finance Act 2023 was gazetted, a petition was filed by Okiya Omtatah and others (the Omtatah petition), and a few days later, the High Court granted conservatory orders barring implementation of the Finance Act 2023.   RELATED STORIES   majanja   High Court bench to give directions on Finance Act petition Tuesday   Gavel   Court lifts orders barring implementation of Finance Act   These orders were confirmed by the High Court on July 10 to apply until the Omtatah petition was heard and determined in full.   Read: KRA updates iTax portal to effect new tax charges   The purpose of conservatory orders is to ensure that the matter, once heard and determined in full, does not result in the decision being rendered nugatory as the issue in dispute will already have been implemented.   An applicant is also required to demonstrate that there is a prima facie case with a likelihood of success, prior to a court granting the conservatory orders.   However, in an interesting twist of events, the government appealed against the orders to the Court of Appeal, and on July 28 the same lifted the conservatory orders, opening the door for effecting of the Finance Act 2023.   The dilemma that finds Kenyan employers and businesses is what to do now. Do taxpayers take the view that the conservatory orders issued by the High Court were to be of no effect, and therefore the new taxes should have been applied as from July 1 when the Finance Act came into effect, notwithstanding the fact that the conservatory orders were in place?   Or do the taxes take effect as from July 28 when the Court of Appeal lifted the conservatory orders?   This is a particularly problematic issue now noting the fact that the KRA has indicated that it expects employers to remit the affordable housing levy which most employers did not deduct from the July 2023 payroll.   The KRA has since then on August 3 issued a statement advising taxpayers that the new PAYE rates have been implemented on iTax with effect from July 1, 2023, and the PAYE (P10) return has been enhanced to enable the administration of the Affordable Housing Levy.   The Ministry of Lands, Public Works, Housing and Urban Development also released a statement on August 2 informing the public that the affordable housing levy took effect on July 1.   The issue of the effect of conservatory orders in Kenya has been the subject of deliberation by our courts in the past.   The High Court in September 2022, in the case of Stanbic Bank Limited versus Commissioner of Domestic Taxes (the Stanbic case), held that the moment collection of excise duty has been suspended by a lawful court order, that tax could not be levied and the commissioner could not lawfully claim from the taxpayer charges, which the commissioner had been restrained from collecting.   Such action would have violated the court order, demeaned the dignity and authority of the court and interfered with the administration of justice and the rule of law.   The Stanbic case emanated from a case filed by the Kenya Bankers Association (KBA) versus Attorney-General and KRA in 2013 in which conservatory orders were issued restraining KRA from levying certain excise duties introduced by Finance Act 2013, until the determination of that petition.   The orders remained in force until April 2017 when the matter was withdrawn by consent of the parties.   The KRA then sought to collect from various banks, including Stanbic Bank, the excise duties which had not been collected from customers of Stanbic Bank for the period from 2013 to 2017.   The High Court in the Stanbic case made a number of key points. Firstly, the High Court asserted that obedience to court orders is a cardinal principle in the administration of justice and maintenance of the rule of law.   Court orders must be obeyed, and the KRA could not have expected taxpayers to have disobeyed the court orders so as to collect the taxes during the pendency of the conservatory orders.   Secondly, the High Court observed that had Stanbic Bank on a precautionary basis gone ahead to collect the excise duty when the conservatory orders were in force, such action would have amounted to an illegality and, therefore, null and void.   In other words, Stanbic Bank would have been in breach of the law for collecting a tax which at the time of the operation of the conservatory orders, was not in force or effect.   Based on the High Court’s pronouncements in the Stanbic case, an argument can be made that the impact of the conservatory orders issued by the High Court on June 30 suspending the implementation of the Finance Act is that any new taxes or tax incentives introduced by the Finance Act could not apply until such orders are lifted.   Since the conservatory orders in the Omtatah petition were lifted on July 28, the provisions of the Finance Act could, therefore, only apply from July 28 onwards.   Where such an argument is adopted, any attempt by taxpayers to collect tax or take advantage of tax incentives or lower taxes under the Finance Act during the period when the conservatory orders were in force would be unlawful, null and void.   This would be so particularly in respect to consumption and agency taxes such as excise duty and value-added tax which are collected by agents at the point of sale or supply.   The challenge, however, that exists is that the courts have not always been as clear about the impact and effect of conservatory orders.   In the case of the Association of Kenya Insurers (AKI) versus Commissioner of Domestic Taxes, determined by the High Court in July 2020, conservatory orders were granted suspending implementation of some of the provisions in the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2020 relating to value added tax on insurance services.   The High Court, while giving the conservatory orders, held that the KRA should not argue that they would be prejudiced by the conservatory orders regardless of the outcome of the petition, as KRA would be able to collect any taxes due, together with interest, from the taxpayers, should the court have found that the petition was not merited, for the entire period when the conservatory orders were in place.   The views of the High Court in the AKI case seem to be contrary to the views of the High Court in the Stanbic case, as the ruling by the High Court in the AKI case suggests that the KRA could retrospectively collect taxes relating to the period in which the conservatory orders were in force.   This is of course contrary to the position of the High Court in the Stanbic case, where the High Court held that court orders had to be obeyed and, therefore, taxes could not be collected when the conservatory orders were in place.   The Stanbic case and the AKI case, both being decisions of the High Court, carry the same weight and can be relied upon by either a taxpayer or the KRA to support contrasting arguments.   We would certainly hope that the three-judge bench appointed by Chief Justice Martha Koome to decide the Omtatah case will consider both decisions and provide their own finding on the effect of conservatory orders, for posterity purposes.   Read: KRA collects a record Sh220.6 billion in tax revenue in June   Such guidance would be vital in providing the much-needed clarity for taxpayers not just in the current circumstances, but also in the future whenever conservatory orders are granted.   Meanwhile, noting that the KRA has updated iTax, on the new PAYE rates and the Affordable Housing Levy, many employers may find themselves taking a conservatory approach where they will remit the taxes for the entire month of July 2023 based on the new rates.

4,"Suicide prevention: Strategies to improve Kenya's mental disorders intervention   MONDAY AUGUST 14 2023   suicide   Low and middle-income countries account for 79 percent of suicides worldwide. PHOTO | SHUTTERSTOCK          Low and middle-income countries account for 79 percent of suicides worldwide. However, their governments and lack of appropriate policies place a low priority on suicide prevention.   World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that for each person that dies by suicide, at least 20 more people attempt suicide. Furthermore, attempted suicide is a risk factor for subsequent completed suicide.   Suicides have long-term ripple effects on society. WHO approximates that for each suicide, at least 135 people are affected to some capacity which translates to 108 million people globally who are severely impacted.   Only 40 countries worldwide have national suicide prevention strategies, with Kenya being one of only five low and middle-income countries to have one.   The vast majority of suicides are preventable, and much can be done to prevent suicide at individual, societal and national levels.   Read: Address rising suicide cases in Kenya urgently   RELATED STORIES   suicide   KITHEKA: Rising cases of suicide should concern us all   suicide   BABU: Openness Kenya needs in treating mental illness as suicide rate rises   Recognition and treatment    Research shows that the majority of people who die by suicide are suffering from one form of a mental disorder at the time of the act.   Clinical depression is, by far, the most common mental disorder in those who die by suicide. Hence, early recognition and treatment of mental disorders, especially clinical depression, is an important suicide prevention strategy.   In Kenya, the prevalence of common mental disorders (CMDs) (mild to moderate cases of depression and anxiety) is estimated to be about 10.3 percent.   It is also estimated that one in four people who seek health services in Kenya have a mental health condition.   It is important to identify such people and refer them to a specialist who can assess and treat them, preventing them from reaching a point where they may become suicidal.   Responsible reporting    Suicide is a sensitive issue that should be reported with care. There are world standards on how suicidal acts should be reported by the media.   For instance, sensitive information about the person and their location, the means of suicide and the contents of a suicide note, should not be published.   This maintains the dignity of the bereaved family and avoids giving any ideas to people with suicidal ideations.    Multiple studies have also found that responsible reporting of suicide can reduce the risk of additional cases (contagion effect).   Responsible coverage of suicide can help change views, dispel myths and be a source of information on the complexities of suicide.    Suicide should be reported as a public health issue that needs to be addressed urgently and should be accompanied by information on risk factors, warning signs and resources for help such as helplines and mental health organisations.   This will also help in raising awareness, decreasing stigma and sensitising the public on mental health issues and suicide behaviour.   Research and data collection   Research and data can help build a comprehensive picture of mental health morbidity. Suicide data that is timely, reliable, and of high quality is crucial for informing policy, decision-making, preventive programmes development and funding.   Research also generates knowledge and evidence of patterns of suicide and self-harm and changes over time.   In Kenya, even though statistics from WHO estimate the suicide rate at 6.1 per 100,000 people, there is little or no official national data on suicides; at times, available data has some crucial variables missing, such as the means of suicide.   This necessitates the development of a high-quality system of reporting and recording data that is timely and robust.   Conclusions drawn from this data can help create interventions for prevention and treatment, development of mental health programmes and necessary policies that promote suicide prevention.   Identify common methods of suicide and prevent them   One key method of preventing suicide deaths is to control access to the common means of suicide. Knowledge of these methods, gained from good data, will help in the development of targeted interventions such as restricting access to lethal means, for example, firearms or pesticides, and implementing safety measures such as barriers on bridges and high buildings.   The Kenya National Suicide Prevention Strategy also recommends collaboration between the Ministry of Agriculture and other stakeholders in creating a pesticide control policy as a means of suicide prevention.   Life skills in school   Life skills programmes provide young people with strategies to manage their mental health. Students can be taught a variety of techniques to deal with stress, prevent mental ill-health and promote good mental health.   These programmes also improve communication skills, making them more willing to open up and seek help when they are struggling.   They will also help educate young people about mental health risk factors, symptoms, and warning signs of suicide.   This education will serve to improve mental health awareness, de-stigmatize mental illness, encourage empathy, and support early intervention systems in the prevention of suicide.   Suicide prevention is complex and requires broad-scope cooperation from all levels to come up with the interventions, preventive measures, policies and means to destigmatise the conversations around suicide.   Read: Tackling mental health crisis   When everyone plays their role, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 of reducing one-third of premature deaths from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promotion of mental health and wellness by 2030 can be achieved.   The reduction of the suicide rate is an indicator of the achievement of this goal.

Ms Asiema has transformed her garden into a masterpiece at her home in Karen, Nairobi.   “When I moved here 22 years ago, I had to determine the kind of garden I wanted to create. I prefer green foliage to the many multi-coloured plants. Too much colour gives me a migraine,” she says.   The first step in her greening project was to ensure an even terrain. The land gradually slopped from her driveway, and the surface was uneven. “I kept adding soil and manure wherever I saw a dent,” she points out.   From her main gate, Ms Asiema has a variety of plants with creepers covering the perimeter wall. Growing beneath the brick wall are hibiscus, spider plants, and clivia plants.

At the gate is a purple bougainvillaea that she hopes will eventually grow and spread to cover the wall on that side.   She also has a potted bloodleaf plant she says is always looking for a way to die. However, with constant spraying with insecticides and care, it still lives.   Before the staircase that leads to her house, she has two large pots with bamboo that she regularly trims to stop them from overgrowing.   Down the stairs is the yellow bird of paradise, which is her favourite. It has a beak-like appearance, and Ms Asiema has the white and yellow variety. “It looks beautiful when you cut the bulb and put it in a vase. When in bloom, I cut them and put them in water in a vase in my house. I love their not-so-bright colour. I also love the leaves, which make it look like a tropical bird,” says Ms Asiema.

Not only is she an avid gardener, but the mother of three also doubles up as a collector, having done most of her collection from expats and markets.   What inspires her? “I like adding bits and pieces to enhance my garden and make it look more appealing.”   Her home is filled with garden-related art, including potting lamps, frogs, and owls. She firmly believes in recycling, so she never gets rid of broken pots. “There is always a way you can use something. For instance, I use broken pots as borders,” says Ms Asiema.   She prefers using big old pots. “They hold a lot of soil and manure but can easily crack if there is too much soil and water.”   The closest she gets to flowery plants are yellow durantas and anthuriums, which won her third prize in the Kenya Horticultural Society Show that ended in June.   “I got third prize in the Anthuriums section and second prize for my succulents. I like succulents for the different shades of green they have. And best of all, to care for the succulents, I just check if the soil is dry.” she says.

At the centre is an old wheelbarrow, where she grows most succulents and orchids.   She had her moment of awakening last year when she fell and broke her leg. She terms it a blessing in disguise.   She says, “One of the things that happened is I discovered that I have orchids. I split them into different pots and am now trying to grow them. I also came up with the idea of growing succulents in a log. When I had the leg injury. I decided to create a garden that I would really love. So I joined Facebook groups. I particularly liked garden art groups. I can see beauty in anything, even broken pieces.”   Ms Asiema, 60, discovered her love for gardening in high school.

Since then, I have always had an appreciation for nature and green things.”   To keep her garden’s foliage lush throughout the year, she dug a well.   Ms Asiema rarely buys her plants. Most of them were inherited from ex-pats and friends.   “When we moved, I came with some of the plants that I had. I would then collect from expats leaving the country and propagate my own plants.”    Orderly garden   Now retired, the former lecturer enjoys dealing with an orderly garden. “For similar plants. I group them together. The succulents are together, the monsters are together, and the two cycads are on the side of the traveller’s palm.”   She did not have a working budget when she started creating her little heaven on earth as “I built it just bit by bit over 22 years. I wouldn’t say that it is difficult because now I have a mature garden.”   BDLMARIAASIEMAaf   A section of a garden in Maria Asiema’s home in Karen on August 1, 2023.

Even in real life, one can still move.   Her biggest struggle has been growing the strings of pearls because “they take a long time to grow.”   Her green section of the garden has lush foliage and a wide variety of ferns, rubber plants, and philodendrons grown on a croton tree. Also, at the back, she has a developing agapanthus fence.   Her most memorable purchase is the string of pearls which cost her Sh800.

If I had the money, I would uproot everything and plant one species of grass, the Pemba grass,” she says.   To keep her garden in good shape,  she goes on an inspection walk every morning to see if a plant needs transplanting or pruning.   No taking risks   Ms Asiema does not take risks with her garden. “I only prune when it is necessary. I am a gardener who has learned the skill on her own.

6,"Heart of Stone: Not even Gal Gadot's star power could redeem this pretentious concept   TUESDAY AUGUST 15 2023   BDHEARTOFSTONE   Heart of Stone is currently holding the number 3 position on Netflix and is slowly creeping to number 1. PHOTO | SHUTTERSTOCK          Number one, a highly coveted position on a global scale across various fields, has shaped our perception of excellence.   Over time, we've come to associate being number one with the best, whether it's winning the gold medal in sports or securing the football trophy, being number one is more or less a prestige.   In this review, we'll be discussing Heart of Stone, released on August 11 and is currently holding the number 3 position on Netflix and is slowly creeping to number 1.   Beyond its view count, the question arises: does this film, reminiscent of Mission: Impossible, truly deserve its position, or is it simply another clever marketing strategy aimed at driving more viewership?   Notably, it features Gal Gadot, the former model turned movie star celebrated for her role as Wonder Woman, within a genre that has been expertly executed by franchises like Mission: Impossible and James Bond movies.   Read: Unmasking Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning’ Part One   RELATED STORIES   BDTmntposter   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: A slice of humour, emotions and action   BDtyrone   They Cloned Tyrone: Masterfully directed, fun at-home viewing   The story   Rachel Stone serves as an intelligence operative in a distinctive role, standing as the sole woman safeguarding her formidable global peacekeeping organisation from the possible loss of its invaluable asset.   What worked   Gal Gadot's latest appearance in a comparable genre was in Red Notice, where she shared the screen with Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.   In this new film, however, she takes centre stage as the main character, and by the movie's conclusion, her superstar status becomes abundantly clear.   This isn't to diminish the other actors' performances, but rather to emphasize that the story revolves around her character, and her enchanting charm and charisma grant her an undeniable and authoritative presence.   Regarding the performances, in general, the entire cast delivered impressive work considering the limitations of the screenplay and script they had to work with.   The film is competently directed, exhibiting a clear structure in the progression of events. Despite its convoluted narrative, viewers are consistently able to follow the storyline.   The cinematography is not groundbreaking, yet it provides an enjoyable viewing experience, capturing stunning visuals of the desert, snowy mountains, and breathtaking sunrises/sunsets.   A particular scene set on the streets of Lisbon showcases skilful nighttime lighting techniques that enhance the atmosphere.   The action sequences and set pieces are not exceptional, they do not match those of the extraction movies, but they certainly surpass the Jennifer Lopez-led Netflix original, The Mother.   If you're a fan of 80's music, occasional tunes that bring a smile to your face pop up every now and then.   Shortcomings   The script is incredibly disappointing, especially considering it's from the same executive producers behind Missions: Impossible Dead Reckoning and the writers of Netflix's Old Guard.   The film feels uninspired, lacks originality, and comes across as lazy. The dialogue is burdened by heavy exposition, making it a tedious watch whenever these moments arise.   The score, especially during action sequences, detracts from the movie. I found myself wishing they had ditched the score and allowed the chaotic ambience noise of the scenes to shine through.   The convoluted story is exacerbated by its two-hour runtime, and the generic MacGuffin lacks any unique spin.   While the general theme draws inspiration from the Mission Impossible franchise, this film fails where Mission Impossible succeeds – in simplifying the plot and establishing clear character motivations.   All in all   Tom Harper, the director, delivered commendable work with a slightly underwhelming script and storyline. However, this had the potential of being something more if it was helmed by Martin Campbell.   Martin renowned for his work on movies like GoldenEye and Casino Royale, possesses a keen understanding of crafting gripping and suspenseful spy and espionage films, often infused with technological elements as seen in GoldenEye.   Read: Indiana Jones the Dial of Destiny: Worthy masterpiece revisit or shameless nostalgia bait?   His skill in developing compelling characters and intense moments is evident, something that Heart of Stone lacked.   To conclude, despite the star power of Gal Gadot and the dedication of the other actors, Heart of Stone falls short as a pretentious, convoluted, and recycled concept, offering very little beyond the first viewing.   ? smanthi@ke.nationmedia.com   Twitter: @stanslausmanthi",Life and Work
7,"ONDIEK: Can I get a life cover with pre-existing conditions?   TUESDAY AUGUST 15 2023   BDHEALTH   Life insurance serves as a vital financial safety net for individuals and their loved ones, providing peace of mind in times of uncertainty. PHOTO | SHUTTERSTOCK          Life insurance serves as a vital financial safety net for individuals and their loved ones, providing peace of mind in times of uncertainty. But what happens if you have a pre-existing medical condition?   Insurance companies recognise that medical illnesses are a reality for many individuals, therefore they provide a variety of coverage to fit diverse health scenarios.   It is crucial to remember, however, that coverage availability and premium costs may vary based on the severity and kind of pre-existing condition.   Below are factors affecting premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions.   Type and severity of the condition: These have a considerable influence on the insurance company's risk assessment.   Compared to severe or uncontrolled illnesses, well-managed or relatively moderate ailments may result in lower rates.   RELATED STORIES   BDCarinsurance   Managing, cutting losses related to motor accidents   BDInsurer   Medical insurance: My insurer only paid Sh1m, what could be the reason?   For example, a person with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, requiring frequent hospitalisations and experiencing complications like kidney problems and neuropathy, would likely be considered high risk, therefore, resulting in a higher insurance premium.   Medical history and treatment: Insurance companies frequently examine an applicant's medical history and treatment plan.   Consistent and proactive care of the disease, as well as frequent medical check-ups, can indicate a commitment to your health, which might contribute to lower premium rates.   Age at diagnosis: It is important to know how old you were when you were diagnosed with the pre-existing ailment.   If you were diagnosed at an earlier age and the disease has remained stable, it may have less of an influence on your rates than if you were diagnosed later in life.   Underlying health: Aside from the pre-existing disease, your general health is important. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, appropriate eating habits and frequent exercise might positively affect the insurer's opinion of your risk level.   Treatment and medications: Some conditions require ongoing medication, while others might necessitate surgical interventions. Insurance companies assess how well these treatments are managing the condition.   Prognosis and future outlook: The insurer might consider the prognosis of your pre-existing condition. If medical advancements suggest a positive long-term outlook, it could have a positive effect on your premiums.   Family History: Your family's medical history could also impact your premiums. If the pre-existing condition runs in your family, for example, an Asthma condition that is inherited within the family medical history the insurer might evaluate your risk differently.   Occupation and Lifestyle: Your occupation and lifestyle choices are taken into account. High-risk jobs and activities might lead to higher premiums.   Policy type and coverage amount: The type of life insurance policy you choose (term, whole life, universal life, etc.) and the coverage amount also influence premiums. Some policies might be more accommodating for individuals with pre-existing conditions.   To obtain affordable medical cover, you might need to consider the following;   Shop Around: Different insurance companies have varying underwriting criteria. Shopping around allows you to compare quotes and find the best coverage at the most reasonable price.   Be honest: Always provide accurate and complete information about your medical history. Withholding information could result in denied claims later on.   Consider guaranteed issue policies: These policies do not require medical underwriting and are designed for individuals who might have difficulty obtaining traditional coverage due to health conditions.   Work with a broker: An experienced insurance agent can guide you through the process, helping you find the right policy and assisting in negotiations with insurers.   Improve your health: While you can't change your medical history, you can adopt a healthier lifestyle moving forward.   Making positive changes to your diet, exercise routine, and overall wellness can improve your insurability.   Remember that each insurance provider is unique, so do your homework, evaluate your options, and make an informed selection based on your own situation.

8,"How to deal with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder   MONDAY AUGUST 14 2023   fotosearchmannotsleeping   Hypervigilance is a symptom that could lead to alcohol abuse as the patient is constantly on the lookout for a repeat of the trauma. PHOTO | SHUTTERSTOCK          My uncle was on a bus near the American Embassy 25 years ago when the bomb exploded. He has been unable to pass anywhere near the memorial site. He says he has nightmares and hence the heavy drinking. His wife left him and he later lost his job. Does he have a mental problem?   I was at the Nairobi Hospital on August 7, 1998, when the bomb exploded at about 10.30 am that Friday morning and was one of the many doctors and nurses who received the injured that morning.   In the months and years that followed this tragedy, the mental health landscape in Kenya changed in many ways.   Hundreds of volunteer counsellors were trained and made their contribution to the recovery process. Many became aware for the first time of the term Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Suddenly, mental health was no longer a subject to be discussed in low tones.   The print and electronic media were flooded with talk about the potential psychological consequences of this tragedy.   In the aftermath of an event that is perceived (by the individual) as potentially life-threatening the state of fear and anxiety that follows during the first month is known as Acute Stress Disorder, and in most cases, this condition recedes, and most people go on to lead normal lives.   RELATED STORIES   grief   NJENGA: Dealing with grieving trauma after bereavement   ptsd   DR NG'ANG'A: Treating post-traumatic stress disorder   In some cases such as that of your uncle, one goes on to develop serious consequences that can lead to serious mental health challenges.   Not having examined your uncle, it is impossible to say with certainty that he has PTSD, but he clearly has features that suggest this diagnosis.   For a start, he was near the site of an explosion that led to the death of more than 200 people, with over 5,000 injured. This fact alone satisfies one of the critical requirements for such a diagnosis.   The fact that he has been unable to go anywhere near the site, would indicate that he has the symptom of avoidance of the place where the near-death experience took place.   Many people who have had similar traumatic experiences avoid some roads where an accident took place, or even an area where politically instigated violence led to the loss of life.   That he has been drinking heavily possibly leading to the loss of both his wife and job is a common sequela in people with this diagnosis.   The symptom of numbness, for example, means that your uncle might lose the feelings of affection that he used to have for your aunt. Such people are sometimes said to have become as cold as a deep freezer.   The symptom of anxiety and difficulties in sleeping can also lead to the abuse of alcohol as the patient tries to calm himself down even as he struggles to sleep.   Hypervigilance is a symptom that could also lead to alcohol abuse as the patient is constantly on the lookout for a repeat of the trauma.   Flashbacks of the traumatic event can be most disturbing as the sounds and smells of the trauma keep coming back to the patient, as he tries to “forget” the event and get on with life.   In our studies following the events of 1998, we found, to our surprise, very high levels of baseline PTSD, meaning that Kenya is a significantly traumatised nation, with both adults and children showing features of PTSD unrelated to the bomb blast.   The trauma cited included domestic violence, road accidents, politically instigated violence, the police, and in the case of school children, witnessing acts of violence both at home and in society in general. PTSD is not a subject that is about to go away in this country.   It is not too late to get help for your uncle. Although his wife might have moved on, and his age is now too advanced to be looking for a job, experts might be able to help him with the alleviation of some complications of PSTD, including alcohol abuse.
